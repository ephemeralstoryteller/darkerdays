# darkerdays: a mod for Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead

Darker Days is a locations mod turned total conversion (TC) that shifts the game towards dark fantasy, originally inspired by the roguelike Sil but taking influences from games like Hexen and, of course, Dark Souls.

Enjoy!


# Meta
Being a TC, this mod will probably not work with other mods. Likewise, tileset support is very limited due to some code hacks I do to work around hardcoded elements of the game.
Cataclysm: DDA was not originally intended to take place in the Middle Ages, so there may be some bugs or other weird glitches. 

## Installation
1. Download the master branch
2. Place the resulting .zip into your mods folder.
3. Unzip, and enjoy!

## Updating
The same as above, but delete any existing copy of Darker Days first just in case.
