# darkerdays: a mod for Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead

Darker Days is a locations mod turned total conversion (TC) that shifts the game towards dark medieval fantasy. Originally inspired by the roguelike Sil and the works of Tolkein, it also takes influences from games like Battle Brothers and Dark Souls.

Enjoy!


# Meta
Being a TC, this mod will probably not work with other mods. Likewise, tileset support is very limited due to some code hacks I do to work around hardcoded elements of the game.
Cataclysm: DDA was not originally intended to take place in a medieval setting, so there may be some bugs or other weird glitches. 

This mod is in alpha and still under development. Install at your own risk.

## Installation
1. Download the master branch
2. Place the resulting .zip into your mods folder.
3. Unzip, and enjoy!

## Updating
The same as above, but delete any existing copy of Darker Days first just in case.
