# darkerdays: a mod for Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead

Darker Days is a content mod that aims to add new locations and monsters to the game, focused primarily on dark fantasy and sci-fi aesthetics. Despite the somewhat ominous name, core gameplay isn't touched, instead intending to enchance a sense of exploration. 

## Installation
1. Download the master branch
2. Place the resulting .zip into your mods folder. If you use the C:DDA launcher, I'd reccomend putting a copy in a seperate folder outside of the C:DDA's install that the launcher for ease of re-adding.
3. Unzip, and enjoy!

## Updating
The same as above, but delete any existing copy of Darker Days first.

## Editing
Darker Days was made with some modularity in mind, so if you don't like anything in particular, you can delete its folder without much trouble.
