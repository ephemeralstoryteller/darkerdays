# darkerdays: a mod for Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead

## Installation
1. Download the master branch
2. Place the resulting .zip into your mods folder. If you use the C:DDA launcher, I'd reccomend putting a copy in a seperate folder outside of the C:DDA's install that the launcher for ease of re-adding.
3. Unzip, and enjoy!

## Updating
The same as above, but delete any existing copy of Darker Days first.


# Content
Darker Days aims to add new locations and monsters to the game to whet your combat skills against and explore for loot - the lifeblood of the survivor! 

## Avaliable

## Planned
### Grafters
A faction loosely based off of Quake's Strogg, these biomechanical cultists from a different dimension use the corpses of the fallen as their minions, with horrifying tech-priests as their top rank.
